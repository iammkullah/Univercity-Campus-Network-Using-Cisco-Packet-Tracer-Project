# Univercity-Campus-Network-Using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer-Project
we have developed a secure campus network (SCN) for sending and receiving information among high-security end-users. We created a topology for a campus of multi networks and virtual local area networks (VLANs) using cisco packet tracer. We also introduced the most critical security configurations, the networking used in our architecture. We used a large number of protocols to protect and accommodate the users of the SCN scheme.
