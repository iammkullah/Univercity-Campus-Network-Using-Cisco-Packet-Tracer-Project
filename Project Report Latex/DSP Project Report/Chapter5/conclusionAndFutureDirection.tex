\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{chap5}
In the previous chapter, we have shown all the simulation and results of our proposed project. From introduction, Literature Review, Proposed Methodology, Result and Simulations. In this chapter, we will conclude our project and will
\section{Conclusion}
This work describes the COMSATS University Islamabad, Attock Campus Network. We have:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Successfully simulated our topology using Cisco Packet Tracer.
%
\item Learned basic knowledge of how department communicate with each other in any organization.
%
\item Discussed a real life university scenario.
%
\end{enumerate}
In this project, we have done following tasks:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Planned, designed, and prototyped the network topology for our university i.e., COMSATS University Islambad, Attock Campus.
%
\item Configured the network in Cisco Packet Tracer with appropriate settings to acheive the connectivity and functionalities.
%
\end{enumerate}

\section{Future Work}

For future work, we recommend the Following things:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Practical implementation of the network.
%
\item Work on the security of the network.
%
\item Can simulate the network on any other simulation software.
%
\item Can work on the accuracy and time of the received signal.
\end{enumerate}
