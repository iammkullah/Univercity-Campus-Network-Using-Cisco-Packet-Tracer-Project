\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap1}
\noindent This project is totally dedicated to the Network Engineer for new and smart learning of the Network Structure. In this concept it is possible for the networker to check the Network Structure of a company spread in the big campus area. The incoming and the outgoing traffic can be maintained along with some security concepts as well. In this logic we use the multiple Routing Protocols in different areas of the university. The practical shows us the proper movement of the packet from one part of the company to the other part of the company. The project comprises of the different departments spread in different buildings of the company. Multiple Routing protocols have been used in different branches and all the departments can communicate with other different departments through the Redistribution among different Routing Protocols.\\

\noindent The East Building has a DHCP server for assigning the IP Addresses to the Hosts in the building as well as a DHCP server has been used in the West Building as well. The Internet Service Provider has been used for Communication of the East and West Building with the Data Centre and Internet through ISP, using the Frame Relay Switching Technology available for Wide Area Network. Routing Protocols EIGRP along with the Synchronous Number, Static Routing, and its concepts including the Default Routing as well has been applied. The different Routing Protocols are running and which has been synchronized to work with Frame Relay Switching Technology.\\

\section{Introduction}
\noindent Audio signal processing is the subfield of signal processing in which we work with the
audio or what we hear. Different objects produce sound like bird, engines, motors noise
in robotic systems. The human can hear these sounds but there is always a mixture of
some background noise in the audio signals that must be processed in order to
get the desire signals.

\end{figure}

The audio sample is taken having some background noise or by adding noise by yourself,
then this audio sample is processed by analyzing it in MATLAB or any other tools. We
perform some operation of the signal, for more precisely analyzing the signals in
Frequency spectrum for analyzing in frequency domain in order to remove noise. Then a
filtered signal is produced at the output.

\section{Filters}
\subsection{Bandpass Filters}
A bandpass filter is an filter that allows signals between two explicit frequencies,
however that oppresses signals at different frequencies. Some bandpass channels
require an outer wellspring of intensity and utilize dynamic parts, for example,
semiconductors and coordinated circuits; these are known as dynamic bandpass filters.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.50]{Chapter1/bandPassFilter}
\caption{Band Pass Filter Frequency Response}
\label{bandPassFilter}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Band Stop Filters}
The Band Stop Filter, (BSF) is another variety of frequency selective circuit that
functions in just the other thanks to the Band Pass Filter we tend to checked out before.
The band stop filter, additionally referred to as a band reject filter, passes all
frequencies with the exception of these inside a such stop band that are greatly
attenuated.\\
Also, a bit like the band pass filter, the band filter may be a second-order (two-pole)
filter having 2 cut-off frequencies, normally referred to as the -3dB or half-power
points manufacturing a good stop band information measure between these 2 -3dB
points.\\
So for a wide-band band stop filter, the filters actual stop band lies between its lower
and higher -3dB points because it attenuates, or rejects any frequency between
these 2 cut-off frequencies. The frequency response curve of a perfect band stop filter
is so given as:

\caption{Band Stop Filter Frequency Response}
\label{stopBandFilter}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Low pass Filter}
A low-pass filter is a filter that permits signals under a cutoff frequency (known as the
pass band) and lessens signals over the cutoff frequency (known as the stop band). By
evacuating a few frequencies, the channel makes a smoothing impact. That is, the
channel delivers moderate changes in yield esteems to make it simpler to see patterns
and lift the general SNR with insignificant signal noise.
