\chapter{Literature Review}
\label{chap2}
In the chapter 1 we have given the introduction of our project, objectives and a thesis break down. Our introduction chapter is giving a complete overview of this project report. This chapter is about the work which is already been done on University Network using Cisco Packet Tracer, and will give a brief details about the articles, papers and literature review.

\section{Literature Review}
This chapter is about studies and literatures that are related to the University Network using Cisco Packet Tracer that the proponents made use of different reading materials (such as thesis, articles, and other web articles) that will help extending the knowledge of the topic. These reading materials will also guide the proponent to improve and develop their proposed system more effectively.

\subsection{Network Topology}
A network topology defines how hosts are connected to a computer network. It
characterizes how the PCs and other hosts are organized, and linked to each other.
\subsubsection{Point to Point Topology}
Point to Point topologies connect two computers together with a single line
connection. The advantage of Point to Point Topology is that it gives a faster connection,
and it is also less expensive than other topologies. The strength of this topology is more
than other kinds of connection\cite{kornilovitch2009fully}.\\

\subsubsection{Bus Topology}
Bus topology, with the inexpensive configuration, many computers are connected
by a single line of cable. Each side of the main cable must be connected to terminals.
This type of network topology is small and very easy to connect devices together to
making the network. The bus topology uses one main cable for all the connection, and
it’s usually seen in smaller networks. If the main cable is broken, there will be a network
failure such as that seen at a local office level\cite{alsarhan2016computer}.\\

\subsubsection{Ring Topology}
Another topology is the ring topology, which uses a connecting computer in a circle
shape. The source computer sends information to the cable ring, and this information
searches for its destination by accessing each computer on the ring until it gets its
destination node. According to the article ``A review of Network Topology'' by Jiang,
“Adjacent pairs of workstations are directly connected. Other pairs of workstations are
indirectly connected, the data passing through one or more intermediate nodes \cite{jiang2015review}.''

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Mesh Topology}
The mesh topology requires each computer to be connected directly to multiple
computers, with more than one line connecting all computers to each other. One good
thing about this topology is that if one line fails or cut, it will use the other paths to send
information to the destination. This reduces the probability of a total network failure. 
Mesh topology is faster compared to other kinds of topology, but it is very expensive.
According to the Clarke ``A disadvantage of a mesh topology is the cost of the additional
cabling and network interfaces to create the multiple pathways between each system \cite{clarke2009comptia}.``\\

\subsubsection{Star Topology}
The star topology is generally used for all networks whereby each device or
computer is connected to a center hub by a direct line. The center hub can be a switch,
router, or server. Each computer connects directly to the center device such as the hub,
router, and server. ``A star topology is designed with each node connected directly to a
central network hub, switch, or concentrator \cite{jiang2015review}.'' It is easy to add
and remove a computer from the network without affecting the network. Pandya, Kartik
mentioned in their article, ``It is easy to replace, install or remove hosts or other devices,
the problem can be easily detected-It is easier to modify or add a new computer without
disturbing the rest of the network by simply running a new line from the computer to the
central location and plugging it to the hub \cite{alsarhan2016computer}.''\\
